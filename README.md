## What did I do? 🤔

🎯 I followed along to [Sonny Sanghas Messenger Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2jKJF4BZOY) to understand how i can: integrate an Upstash/Redis database, build realtime features using Pusher. 

## What could I improve? 🛠️

🎯 Different chatrooms
- Enhance the user experience by allowing users to create and join different chatrooms.

🎯 More ways to sign in
- Provide additional authentication methods to cater to a broader audience and alternative authentication providers.

🎯 Performace Optimization
- Consider lazy loading assets and optimizing images to reduce loading times.
